Blackjack Card Game
Background and Motivation
Card games have been popular since the fourteenth century in Europe. Blackjack, in particular, is a widely played casino game. The objective is to have a card count higher than the dealer but less than 21. This project aims to create a unique version of Blackjack where the Ace card's rank is always one, offering a new twist to the classic game.

Problem Statement
The primary goal of this version is to set the Ace card object's rank to always be one. Additionally, the game is designed to be played in just one round, adding a layer of challenge and excitement.

Approach
This project is implemented in Java and aims to achieve the following milestones:

Create a data structure for a standard deck of 52 playing cards.
Allow one player to play against a computer.
Implement a text-based interface for ease of computation.
